# Spreading dye sampler

A Python implementation of the spreading dye sampling algorithm of
[Wang et al. (2012)](http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1600-0587.2012.07786.x).
This version has an extension to allow masking off of areas, and
squeezing the dye blot against that mask.

See the [API documentation]() for more details.
